You can do it with replica as mentioned in Compose specification:

version: '3'
services:
  worker:
    image: dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 6

One can use docker-compose --compatibility up to make Docker accept a deploy section without using swarm.

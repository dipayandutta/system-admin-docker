Why Disable Swap while installing kubernetes
---------------------------------------------------
The idea of kubernetes is to tightly pack instances to as close to 100% utilized as possible. All deployments should be pinned with CPU/memory limits. So if the scheduler sends a pod to a machine it should never use swap at all. You don't want to swap since it'll slow things down.

Its mainly for performance.

Increasing Docker ulimits

Docker ulimits limit a program's resource utilization to prevent a run-away bug or security breach from bringing the whole system down. The default limit for Amazon AWS is 1024, which is not enough for Sisense to run properly.
The instructions below describe how to check what your current value is, and then increase it to enable Sisense to run.

To increase the ulimit value:

    Connect to the desired host and execute the following command:

    systemctl show docker

    Search for NOFILE.

    If the output is 1024, edit the file:

    /etc/sysconfig/docker

    and replace the line:

    OPTIONS=" â€” default-ulimit nofile=1024:4096"

    with:

    OPTIONS="--default-ulimit nofile=1024000:1024000"

    Restart the Docker daemon.

    sudo systemctl restart docker

-----------------------------------------------


The latest docker supports setting ulimits through the command line and the API. For instance, docker run takes --ulimit <type>=<soft>:<hard> and there can be as many of these as you like. So, for your nofile, an example would be --ulimit nofile=262144:262144
